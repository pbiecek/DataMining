Advances in Data Mining:
------------------------

# Motto

> It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data.
> Sherlock Holmes

> Data should be at the heart of strategic decision making in businesses, whether they are huge multinationals or small family-run operations. Data can provide insights that help you answer your key business questions. Data leads to insights; business owners and managers can turn those insights into decisions and actions that improve the business. This is the power of data.

Projects:
---------

You may work on projects in a group of 2-4 people. You cannot work with same person in both projects.
You will present your results during classes, but you should submit your solution to GitHub before classes.
Projects that are not presented will not be scores. 
Al least 50% of the team is required to be present during the project presentation.

1. Project - Classification

2. Project - Clustering

Grade:
------

Final grade will be based on points from projects (each project id 15+20+25 points, different number of points for each phase of the project) and 10 home works (each home work is for 4 points), and final test 40 points.

Homeworks:
----------
There will be some home works after some classes (around 10 home works).
Each correct solution gives you 4 points.
Home works have to be done personally. No group work here!
Home works have to be submitted to github not later than 1 week after announcement.

How to cope with challenges in your code:
-----------------------------------------

1. Go carefully through your code
2. Put instructions in proper order (make a sequence)
3. Make your code clean
4. Search any clues in google, e.g. stack overflow, R-bloggers, quick-R
5. Ask your friends, try to do group work and brainstorming
6. If you still have even more problems, write to the lecturer, but with a precise instruction what is wrong and clean code
7. Please respect my time

More remarks:

* Usually in training sets you should have target variable if it is supervised learning, e.g. classification
* Please send (make a pull request with) only *RMD, *R files
* file names of your homework: homework - number - initials (or nick, but I should know about you identity)
* Always some up with written conclusions
* Drive conclusions about the data and plots
* More plots and less number, especially big tables of numbers 
* When you show numbers, try to put plots to visualise this data directly after them
* Often when you remove outliers, the plot is nicer
* Avoid statments: "it can be seen easily..”? In reports there cannot be any statements that are not data driven especially when it is easy to show the reasoning.

Using git repo:

useful instructions: `git clone`, `git status`, `git add`, `git commit -m "..."`, `git push origin branch-name`, `git pull ...`
