Project 2 - Internet of Things

# Introduction

The main goal is to excersise methods for clustering and description of data.

At first show main characteristics of the data.
Find segments of visitors / pupils with similar behavior. 
Show the flow of visitors across different stations.

# The Data

Dataset ia available from your teacher. You can copy during classes or write an email: wroblewskaa **at** mini.pw.edu.pl


# The Goal

In this dataset you have detailed information about pupils and the way of visiting exibitions in Copernicus Center.

# Phases

After each phase you should create a single report (e.g. with the use of knitr). This report will be presented during classes and scored.

In the first phase you should characterize types of interactions with different machines (exploratory analysis). Try to answer following questions:

* is there a relation between the duration of an interaction and variables like knowledge of the pupil, the occupation of parents etc.
* what is the average (or distribution) time of interaction with a given machine
* and many other questions: use brainstorming in your team

In the second phase you should try to segment visitors into separate categories / segments. Try to answer following questions:

* how to define the similarity measure between visitors?
* is the population homogenous or heterogonous. If heterogeneous then how many groups you can derive/define? 
* How to characterize different groups of visitors?
* Is there a pattern in stations that visitor tends to visit?

In the third phase you should create a brief summary of your results. Try to make it an easy to understand for non-specialist.
 We will host a guest that will help to give an feedback related to these analyses.
